Driver Drowsiness Detector using Transfer Learning Approach  

# Project Description

A self-driving car or autonomous car is a vehicle that uses a combination of sensors, cameras, radar, and artificial intelligence (AI) to travel between destinations without a human operator. One of the features of such an advanced card is driver drowsiness detection. Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology that helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy. Various studies have suggested that around 20% of all road accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads.

There are various methods that can be used to find the drowsiness of the driver such as Steering pattern monitoring, Vehicle position in lane monitoring, Driver eye/face monitoring, etc. In this project, the driver face monitoring technique has been used to find the drowsiness.

This dataset contains images with the various position of the eyes i.e.,

Closed, Open, Yawn, no_yawn.

Methodology
Driver Drowsiness Detection with Transfer Learning DL Technique

Deliverable
Train the model for multi class classification approach and identify the class from the folder name of the dataset.

Project Outcomes ● Explore various ways of computer vision methods to predict drowsiness ● Identify various ML and DL approaches to predict drowsiness ● Identify the best DL model to train the data ● Train deep learning model for drowsiness.
